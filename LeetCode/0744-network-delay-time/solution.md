### Code Explanation

#### Key Concepts
The user's code implements **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, which is a classic algorithm for finding the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted, directed graph with non-negative edge weights. The implementation uses a **Priority Queue** (achieved with Python's `heapq` module) to efficiently select the next node to visit, and an **Adjacency List** to represent the network graph.

#### Identification of Algorithm
The problem asks for the "minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal" starting from a source `k`. This translates to finding the single-source shortest paths from `k` to all other nodes in a weighted directed graph. The time for the signal to reach *all* nodes is determined by the time it takes to reach the farthest node (i.e., the maximum of all the shortest paths). Dijkstra's algorithm is the standard and most efficient algorithm for this specific problem, given that the edge weights (travel times) are non-negative. The code's structure—initializing distances to infinity, setting the source distance to zero, and using a priority queue to iteratively explore the closest unvisited node—is the textbook implementation of Dijkstra's.

#### Intuition and Logic
The algorithm works by iteratively finding the shortest path from the source `k` to every other node. It maintains a set of nodes whose shortest path from the source is already known.

1.  **Graph Representation**:
    *   An adjacency list, `adjList`, is created as a dictionary where each key is a node label (`1` to `n`) and the value is a list of its outgoing connections.
    *   The code iterates through the input `times` list. For each entry `(u, v, w)`, it adds a tuple `(v, w)` to the list of neighbors for node `u`, representing a directed edge from `u` to `v` with a weight of `w`.

2.  **Initialization for Dijkstra's**:
    *   `dist`: A dictionary is created to store the shortest distance found so far from the source `k` to every other node. It's initialized with `INF` (infinity) for all nodes, signifying that they are not yet reached.
    *   `dist[k] = 0`: The distance from the source `k` to itself is set to `0`.
    *   `PQ`: A list `PQ` is created to be used as a min-priority queue. It's initialized by pushing the tuple `(0, k)`, representing that the starting node `k` is reachable with a distance of `0`. The distance is the first element of the tuple so that the heap correctly prioritizes the nodes with the smallest distances.

3.  **Main Loop (Algorithm Execution)**:
    *   The `while len(PQ) != 0:` loop continues as long as there are nodes to process.
    *   `d, node = heapq.heappop(PQ)`: It extracts the element with the smallest distance `d` from the priority queue. This greedily selects the unvisited node closest to the source `k`.
    *   **Relaxation Step**: The code then iterates through all neighbors (`adj`) of the popped `node`. For each neighbor, it checks if the path through the current `node` is shorter than the currently known shortest path to that neighbor (`if d + w < dist[adj]`).
    *   If a shorter path is found, it updates the distance (`dist[adj] = d + w`) and pushes the neighbor onto the priority queue with its new, improved distance (`heapq.heappush(PQ, (d+w, adj))`).

4.  **Result Calculation**:
    *   After the loop terminates, the `dist` dictionary contains the shortest travel time from `k` to every reachable node.
    *   `maxDist = max(dist.values())`: The code finds the maximum value in the `dist` dictionary. This value represents the time it takes for the signal to reach the "bottleneck" or farthest node, which is the minimum time required for *all* nodes to receive the signal.
    *   `return maxDist if maxDist < INF else -1`: If `maxDist` is still infinity, it means at least one node was unreachable. In this case, it's impossible for all nodes to get the signal, so `-1` is returned. Otherwise, the calculated `maxDist` is returned.

#### "Gotcha" Points and Tricks
*   **Priority Queue with Tuples**: The code correctly uses tuples `(distance, node)` in the priority queue. Python's `heapq` module builds a min-heap, and by placing the distance first, it naturally ensures that `heapq.heappop` always returns the node with the minimum current distance.
*   **1-Based Indexing**: The problem uses 1-based indexing for nodes (`1` to `n`). The code correctly handles this by creating the `adjList` and `dist` dictionaries with keys in the range `range(1, n+1)`.
*   **Handling Unreachability**: The final check `if maxDist < INF else -1` is a clean and robust way to handle the case where the graph is not strongly connected from node `k`, meaning some nodes are impossible to reach.

#### Potential Errors and Pitfalls
*   **Off-by-One with Indexing**: A common error is mixing up 0-based and 1-based indexing. Forgetting to initialize the data structures from `1` to `n` (e.g., using `range(n)` instead of `range(1, n+1)`) would lead to `KeyError` or incorrect logic. The user's code avoids this.
*   **Suboptimal Path Updates**: A crucial part of Dijkstra's is updating a node's distance and re-adding it to the priority queue if a shorter path is found. Forgetting the `heapq.heappush` call inside the `if` block would mean that the improved path information is never used to explore subsequent nodes, leading to an incorrect result.
*   **Stale Entries in Priority Queue**: This implementation may have multiple entries for the same node in the priority queue if shorter paths are found repeatedly. For example, a node could be in the queue with distance 10, and later a path of distance 8 is found, so it's added again. The `if d + w < dist[adj]` check implicitly handles this correctly, as the logic will always be based on the best distance stored in the `dist` map. The processing of a "stale" entry (the one with distance 10) will simply fail to relax any edges that have already been relaxed by the shorter path.
