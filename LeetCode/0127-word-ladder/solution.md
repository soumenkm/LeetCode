<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder">127. Word Ladder</a></h2><h3>Hard</h3><hr><p>A <strong>transformation sequence</strong> from word <code>beginWord</code> to word <code>endWord</code> using a dictionary <code>wordList</code> is a sequence of words <code>beginWord -&gt; s<sub>1</sub> -&gt; s<sub>2</sub> -&gt; ... -&gt; s<sub>k</sub></code> such that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.</li>
	<li>Every <code>s<sub>i</sub></code> for <code>1 &lt;= i &lt;= k</code> is in <code>wordList</code>. Note that <code>beginWord</code> does not need to be in <code>wordList</code>.</li>
	<li><code>s<sub>k</sub> == endWord</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Given two words, <code>beginWord</code> and <code>endWord</code>, and a dictionary <code>wordList</code>, return <em>the <strong>number of words</strong> in the <strong>shortest transformation sequence</strong> from</em> <code>beginWord</code> <em>to</em> <code>endWord</code><em>, or </em><code>0</code><em> if no such sequence exists.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> beginWord = &quot;hit&quot;, endWord = &quot;cog&quot;, wordList = [&quot;hot&quot;,&quot;dot&quot;,&quot;dog&quot;,&quot;lot&quot;,&quot;log&quot;,&quot;cog&quot;]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> One shortest transformation sequence is &quot;hit&quot; -&gt; &quot;hot&quot; -&gt; &quot;dot&quot; -&gt; &quot;dog&quot; -&gt; cog&quot;, which is 5 words long.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> beginWord = &quot;hit&quot;, endWord = &quot;cog&quot;, wordList = [&quot;hot&quot;,&quot;dot&quot;,&quot;dog&quot;,&quot;lot&quot;,&quot;log&quot;]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The endWord &quot;cog&quot; is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= beginWord.length &lt;= 10</code></li>

### Code Explanation

#### Key Concepts
The user's code implements the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm. It uses a `set` for efficient word lookups and a `deque` (double-ended queue) as the queue for the BFS traversal.

#### Identification of Algorithm
The problem asks for the length of the *shortest* transformation sequence. This is a classic shortest path problem on an unweighted graph. The words can be thought of as nodes in a graph, and an edge exists between two words if they are one letter apart. BFS is the ideal algorithm for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores the graph layer by layer, guaranteeing that the first time it reaches the target node (`endWord`), it does so via a shortest path.

#### Intuition and Logic
The core idea is to perform a BFS starting from `beginWord` to find the shortest path to `endWord`.

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   `chars`: A list of all lowercase letters is created to help generate potential word transformations.
    *   `wordSet`: A `set` is created from the `wordList` and `beginWord`. This provides fast, O(1) average-time lookups to check if a generated word is valid and available.
    *   `Q`: A `deque` is initialized to act as the BFS queue. It's seeded with the starting tuple `(beginWord, 1)`, where `1` represents the length of the path (the `beginWord` itself is the first word).
    *   `wordSet.remove(beginWord)`: The `beginWord` is immediately removed from `wordSet` to mark it as visited, preventing the algorithm from cycling back to the start.
    *   `res = 0`: A variable `res` is initialized to `0` to store the final result.

2.  **BFS Traversal**:
    *   The `while len(Q) != 0:` loop continues as long as there are words to be processed in the queue.
    *   `word, dist = Q.popleft()`: In each iteration, the code dequeues the next word and its current path distance.
    *   **Neighbor Generation**: Instead of pre-building a graph, the code generates neighbors on the fly. It iterates through each character index `i` of the current `word`. For each index, it creates a list `modWords` containing all possible words formed by substituting the character at `i` with every letter in `chars`.
    *   **Neighbor Validation**: It then iterates through each `mw` (modified word) in `modWords`.
        *   `if mw in wordSet:`: It checks if the generated word exists in the `wordSet`. This check serves two purposes: validating that `mw` is a real word from the dictionary and that it has not been visited yet.
        *   If valid, `Q.append((mw, dist+1))` adds the new word and its incremented distance to the back of the queue for future processing.
        *   `wordSet.remove(mw)`: The word `mw` is removed from the set. This is a crucial step that marks the word as "visited" and ensures that we find the shortest path, as this word will not be added to the queue again via a different (and necessarily longer) path.
        *   `if mw == endWord:`: If the newly found word is the target `endWord`, the result `res` is updated to the current path length, `dist + 1`.

3.  **Return Value**:
    *   After the queue is empty, the function returns `res`. If `endWord` was found, `res` will hold its shortest path length. If the loop completes without ever finding `endWord`, `res` remains `0`, correctly indicating that no such transformation sequence exists.

#### "Gotcha" Points and Tricks
*   **On-the-Fly Graph Generation**: The code smartly avoids the overhead of building an explicit adjacency list for the graph. By generating potential one-letter-different neighbors for each word and checking against the `wordSet`, it constructs the necessary graph connections as it traverses.
*   **`set` as a Visited Tracker**: The `wordSet` is cleverly used as both a dictionary of valid words and a set of unvisited nodes. Removing a word from the set as soon as it's added to the queue (`Q`) is an efficient way to mark it as visited and prevent redundant processing.
*   **State in Queue**: The queue `Q` stores tuples `(word, dist)` containing not just the node (the word) but also its state (the distance from the start). This is a standard BFS pattern for path-finding problems.

#### Potential Errors and Pitfalls
*   **Continuing Search After Finding Solution**: The code updates a `res` variable when it finds the `endWord` but continues the `while` loop until the queue is empty. A more performant implementation could `return dist + 1` immediately upon finding the `endWord`. However, since BFS explores level by level, the first time `endWord` is found guarantees the shortest path, so the user's logic is still correct.
*   **Forgetting to Remove from Set**: A common mistake would be to check `if mw in wordSet` and add `mw` to the queue but forget to `wordSet.remove(mw)`. This would lead to nodes being added to the queue multiple times and could result in an infinite loop if there are cycles, or at best, incorrect (non-shortest) paths.
*   **Initial `wordSet` State**: Forgetting to add `beginWord` to the initial `wordSet` could cause issues, but the user's code correctly handles this with `set([beginWord] + wordList)`. Similarly, not removing `beginWord` after adding it to the queue would cause it to be processed as a neighbor of itself, which is inefficient. The user's code handles this correctly.
