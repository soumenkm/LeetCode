### Code Explanation

#### Key Concepts
The solution uses **Depth-First Search (DFS)** on a directed graph to solve this problem. The core task is **Cycle Detection** in a directed graph. The graph itself is represented using an **Adjacency List**.

#### Identification of Algorithm
The problem can be modeled as a directed graph where courses are the vertices (nodes) and prerequisites are the directed edges. If you must take course `v` before course `u` (`[u, v]`), this represents a directed edge from `v` to `u` (`v -> u`). You can finish all courses if and only if the graph of course dependencies contains no cycles. A cycle like `0 -> 1 -> 0` would mean you need to finish course 1 to take 0, and finish 0 to take 1, which is impossible.

Therefore, the problem is equivalent to detecting if the constructed graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). A standard and robust algorithm for cycle detection in a directed graph is to perform a Depth-First Search while keeping track of the state of each node using a 3-color system.

#### Intuition and Logic
The user's code correctly implements a DFS-based cycle detection algorithm.

1.  **Graph Representation**:
    *   An adjacency list, `adj_list`, is created, where `adj_list[i]` will store a list of all courses that have course `i` as a prerequisite.
    *   The `for u, v in prerequisites:` loop iterates through the prerequisite pairs. For a pair `[u, v]`, it adds an edge from `v` to `u` by doing `adj_list[v].append(u)`. This correctly models the dependency "to take `u`, you must first take `v`".

2.  **DFS State Tracking (`color` array)**:
    *   A `color` array is used to track the state of each node during the traversal. It uses three states:
        *   `0`: White - The node has not been visited yet.
        *   `1`: Gray - The node is currently being visited (it's in the current recursion stack).
        *   `2`: Black - The node and all its descendants have been fully visited.

3.  **DFS Function for Cycle Detection (`DFS(node)`)**:
    *   When the DFS visits a `node`, it first marks it as gray (`color[node] = 1`).
    *   It then iterates through all adjacent nodes (`adj`) of the current `node`.
    *   If an adjacent node `adj` is white (`color[adj] == 0`), it means this node hasn't been visited, so a recursive `DFS(adj)` call is made. The result of this recursive call (a boolean indicating if a cycle was found) is propagated up.
    *   **The crucial step**: If an adjacent node `adj` is gray (`color[adj] == 1`), it means we have found a node that is already in our current recursion path. This is a "back edge" and signifies that a cycle exists. The function sets `has_cycle` to `True`.
    *   After visiting all neighbors, the current `node` is marked as black (`color[node] = 2`), indicating it's finished.
    *   The function returns `has_cycle`, which is `True` if a cycle was detected in the subgraph starting from `node`.

4.  **Main Loop**:
    *   The code iterates through all courses from `0` to `V-1`.
    *   It calls `DFS(i)` for any node `i` that is still white (`color[i] == 0`). This ensures that all components of a potentially disconnected graph are checked for cycles.
    *   A global `has_cycle` flag accumulates the results from all DFS calls.

5.  **Final Result**:
    *   The function returns `not has_cycle`. This is because the question asks if it's *possible* to finish all courses. This is true if there are *no* cycles.

#### "Gotcha" Points and Tricks
*   **Correct Graph Direction**: A common mistake is to reverse the direction of the prerequisite edges. The user correctly models `[u,v]` as an edge `v -> u`.
*   **3-Color System**: Using a simple boolean `visited` flag is not enough for cycle detection in directed graphs. The 3-color approach is essential to distinguish between a back edge (which indicates a cycle) and a cross edge (an edge to a node in a different, already visited branch, which is fine). The user's code correctly implements this robust system.
*   **Handling Disconnected Graphs**: The main `for i in range(V):` loop is critical. Without it, the code might only check the graph component connected to node `0` and miss a cycle in a separate component.
*   **Result Inversion**: The problem asks for a positive confirmation (`True` if possible), while the algorithm detects a negative condition (a cycle). The final `return not has_cycle` correctly inverts the logic to match the problem's requirement.

#### Potential Errors and Pitfalls
*   **Using 2-Color DFS**: A developer might try to use a simple `visited` set. This would fail to detect cycles correctly. For example, it couldn't differentiate between finding a node that's part of the current recursive path versus a node that was just part of a previously completed path.
*   **Incorrect Edge Mapping**: Setting up the `adj_list` as `adj_list[u].append(v)` would represent the dependencies backward and produce incorrect results for most inputs.
*   **Forgetting to Check All Components**: Simply calling `DFS(0)` without a loop would fail on graphs where the cycle does not involve node 0 or is in a disconnected component.
*   **Recursive Flag Propagation**: Forgetting to propagate the cycle detection result up the recursion stack (e.g., just calling `DFS(adj)` without using its return value `res`) would mean a cycle found deep in the graph would not be reported to the top-level caller. The user's `has_cycle = (has_cycle or res)` correctly handles this.
