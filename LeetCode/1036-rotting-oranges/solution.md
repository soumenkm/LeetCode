**Problem Statment:**
```markdown
<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges">1036. Rotting Oranges</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><p>You are given an <code>m x n</code> <code>grid</code> where each cell can have one of three values:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>0</code> representing an empty cell,</li>
	<li><code>1</code> representing a fresh orange, or</li>
	<li><code>2</code> representing a rotten orange.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every minute, any fresh orange that is <strong>4-directionally adjacent</strong> to a rotten orange becomes rotten.</p>

<p>Return <em>the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange</em>. If <em>this is impossible, return</em> <code>-1</code>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/16/oranges.png" style="width: 650px; height: 137px;" />
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
<strong>Output:</strong> -1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[0,2]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>m == grid.length</code></li>
	<li><code>n == grid[i].length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 10</code></li>

### Code Explanation

#### Key Concepts
The user's code implements a **Multi-Source Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. This algorithm is perfectly suited for finding the shortest time for a process that spreads simultaneously from multiple starting points in an unweighted grid. The core data structures are a `deque` for an efficient queue, a 2D list (`visited`) to track visited cells, and a helper function (`find_adj`) to identify neighbors.

#### Identification of Algorithm
The problem asks for the minimum number of minutes for a process (rotting) to spread to all eligible cells (fresh oranges). This is a shortest path problem on an unweighted graph (the grid). BFS is the standard algorithm for finding the shortest path in terms of number of steps or layers in an unweighted graph.

Since rotting starts from all existing rotten oranges at the same time, this is a multi-source problem. The user correctly identifies this and initializes the BFS queue with all initially rotten oranges, which is the signature of a Multi-Source BFS approach. This is far more efficient than running a separate BFS for each rotten orange.

#### Intuition and Logic
The solution simulates the rotting process layer by layer (minute by minute) starting from all initially rotten oranges.

1.  **Initial Scan and Setup**:
    *   The code begins by iterating through the `grid` once to gather initial state information.
    *   `num_fresh`: A counter `num_fresh` is used to count the total number of fresh oranges. (Note: this variable is ultimately not used in the logic for determining the final result).
    *   `rot`: A list `rot` is populated with the `(i, j)` coordinates of every rotten orange (`2`).
    *   `dirs`: A standard list of tuples representing the four cardinal directions for finding neighbors.
    *   `find_adj`: A helper function is defined to find valid, fresh neighbors for a given cell.

2.  **BFS Initialization**:
    *   `visited`: A 2D list is created to keep track of cells that have been visited (i.e., have become rotten).
    *   `Q`: A `deque` is initialized. It is seeded with the coordinates of all initially rotten oranges found in the `rot` list. Each element is a tuple `(i, j, time)`, where `time` is initialized to `0` for all starting oranges.
    *   The initial rotten oranges are also marked as visited in the `visited` grid.

3.  **The BFS Loop**:
    *   The `while len(Q) != 0:` loop runs as long as there are oranges in the queue to process.
    *   `i, j, time = Q.popleft()`: It dequeues an orange, getting its coordinates and the `time` (minute) at which it became rotten. The `time` variable will hold the value of the last level processed by the BFS.
    *   `adj = find_adj(i, j)`: It calls the helper function to get a list of all adjacent cells that are within bounds and contain a fresh orange (`grid[ni][nj] == 1`).
    *   For each fresh neighbor `(ni, nj)`:
        *   `if visited[ni][nj] == 0:`: It checks if this fresh orange has already been queued for rotting.
        *   If not, it enqueues the neighbor with an incremented time: `Q.append((ni, nj, time+1))`.
        *   It immediately marks the neighbor as visited: `visited[ni][nj] = 1`.

4.  **Final Result and Validation**:
    *   After the BFS queue is empty, all *reachable* fresh oranges have been marked as visited.
    *   A final, crucial verification step is performed: the code iterates through the entire `grid` again.
    *   `if grid[i][j] == 1 and visited[i][j] == 0:`: This condition checks for any orange that is still fresh (`grid[i][j] == 1`) but was never reached by the BFS (`visited[i][j] == 0`). If such an orange is found, it's impossible to rot all of them, so the function returns `-1`.
    *   If the validation loop completes without finding any unreachable fresh oranges, it means the process was successful. The function returns the final value of the `time` variable, which represents the minute the last orange became rotten.

#### "Gotcha" Points and Tricks
*   **Multi-Source Initialization**: The key to an efficient solution is populating the initial BFS queue with *all* rotten oranges at `time=0`. This correctly models the simultaneous nature of the rotting process.
*   **Final Verification Loop**: A simple BFS completion does not guarantee success. The code correctly includes a final loop over the grid to check for isolated fresh oranges that were never reached, a critical edge case.
*   **Time Tracking**: The `time` variable from the last item popped from the queue will correctly be the maximum time elapsed. Because BFS explores layer by layer, the last items to be processed will be those at the greatest "depth" or latest minute.
*   **Handling No Fresh Oranges**: The code correctly handles the edge case where there are no fresh oranges to begin with (`grid = [[0,2]]`). The loops will complete, and the initial `time` of `0` will be returned, which is the correct answer.

#### Potential Errors and Pitfalls
*   **Forgetting the Impossible Case**: A common mistake is to assume that if the BFS completes, all oranges have rotted. This would fail for grids with isolated, unreachable fresh oranges. The user's code correctly handles this with the post-BFS check.
*   **Unused Variable**: The variable `num_fresh` is calculated at the beginning but is never referenced again. The logic to detect un-rotted oranges is correctly handled by the `visited` array, making the initial count unnecessary for this specific implementation.
*   **Marking Visited Late**: Marking a node as visited when it is *popped* from the queue, rather than when it is *pushed*, is a common mistake that can lead to the same node being added to the queue multiple times, causing inefficiency. The user correctly marks nodes as visited at the time of insertion into the queue.
