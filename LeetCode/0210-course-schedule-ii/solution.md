Course Schedule II</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><p>There are a total of <code>numCourses</code> courses you have to take, labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>numCourses - 1</code>. You are given an array <code>prerequisites</code> where <code>prerequisites[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that you <strong>must</strong> take course <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> first if you want to take course <code>a<sub>i</sub></code>.</p>

<ul>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [0,1]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

### Code Explanation

#### Key Concepts
The user's code implements a **Depth-First Search (DFS)**-based algorithm to solve this problem. The core ideas involved are:
1.  **Graph Representation**: Using an adjacency list to model the course dependencies.
2.  **Cycle Detection in Directed Graph**: Employing a three-state coloring scheme (`white`, `gray`, `black`) within the DFS to detect if a cycle exists.
3.  **Topological Sort**: If no cycle is found, the algorithm computes a valid course order by sorting the courses based on their DFS finishing times.

#### Identification of Algorithm
The problem asks for a linear ordering of items that have dependency constraints. This is the definition of a **topological sort**. Furthermore, a valid ordering is only possible if there are no circular dependencies, which means the underlying graph must be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

A classic algorithm for performing a topological sort and simultaneously detecting cycles is using DFS. The user's code implements this specific pattern, identifiable by:
*   The construction of a directed `adj_list`.
*   A recursive `DFS` function.
*   A `color` array to track the visitation state of each node (0 for unvisited, 1 for visiting, 2 for fully visited). This is the key to detecting cycles with DFS.
*   The calculation of `start` and `finish` times for each node, which is characteristic of a DFS-based topological sort.

#### Intuition and Logic
The solution models the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph where an edge from course `v` to `u` (`v -> u`) means `v` must be taken before `u`. The algorithm then performs a DFS traversal on this graph to find a topological sort and check for cycles.

1.  **Graph Construction**:
    *   An `adj_list` is initialized, where `adj_list[i]` will hold all courses that have course `i` as a prerequisite.
    *   The code iterates through `prerequisites`. For each pair `[u, v]`, it adds an edge from `v` to `u` (`adj_list[v].append(u)`), correctly representing that `v` must be completed before `u`.

2.  **DFS and Cycle Detection Setup**:
    *   `color`: An array to track the state of each node. `0` (white) means unvisited. `1` (gray) means the node is currently in the recursion stack (being visited). `2` (black) means the node and all its descendants have been fully visited.
    *   `start` & `finish`: Arrays to store the discovery and finishing timestamps from a global `time` counter. These are essential for the topological sort.
    *   `time`: A counter that increments each time a node is first discovered and each time it is finished.

3.  **The `DFS` Function**:
    *   When `DFS(node)` is called, it first marks `node` as "visiting" by setting `color[node] = 1`.
    *   It then iterates through all adjacent nodes (`adj`) of the current `node`.
    *   If a neighbor `adj` has `color[adj] == 1`, it means the DFS has found a path back to a node that is still in the current recursion stack. This is a "back edge" and proves a **cycle** exists. The `has_cycle` flag is set to `True`.
    *   If a neighbor `adj` has `color[adj] == 0` (unvisited), a recursive call `DFS(adj)` is made. The result of this recursive call (whether it found a cycle) is OR-ed with the current `has_cycle` flag to ensure the cycle detection result is propagated up.
    *   After visiting all neighbors, the `node` is marked as "fully visited" by setting `color[node] = 2`, and its `finish` time is recorded.

4.  **Main Execution Flow**:
    *   The main part of the code iterates through all courses from `0` to `V-1`.
    *   If a course `i` has `color[i] == 0`, it means it hasn't been visited yet (it could be part of a disconnected component of the graph), so a new `DFS(i)` traversal is started from it.
    *   The global `has_cycle` flag accumulates the results from all DFS traversals.

5.  **Result Generation**:
    *   If `has_cycle` is `True` after checking all nodes, it's impossible to schedule the courses, so an empty list `[]` is returned.
    *   If no cycle exists, a valid order is generated. A fundamental property of DFS is that a topological sort is the sequence of vertices ordered by their **decreasing finish times**.
    *   The code achieves this by creating a list of `(finish_time, course_number)` tuples, sorting this list in reverse order based on `finish_time`, and then extracting just the `course_number`s.

#### "Gotcha" Points and Tricks
*   **Three-State Coloring**: The use of a `color` array with three states is the correct and robust way to detect cycles in a directed graph. A simple boolean `visited` flag is not enough, as it can't distinguish between a back edge (a cycle) and a cross edge to a node in a different, already-visited subtree.
*   **Topological Sort via Finish Times**: The core trick of the final step is non-obvious but powerful: sorting the vertices by descending DFS finish time guarantees a valid topological ordering for any Directed Acyclic Graph.
*   **Handling Disconnected Components**: The main `for i in range(V)` loop ensures that the algorithm works correctly even if the graph is not connected (i.e., there are multiple independent sets of courses and prerequisites). It will start a new DFS for each component.

#### Potential Errors and Pitfalls
*   **Reversing Prerequisite Logic**: A common mistake is to create the edge `u -> v` for a prerequisite `[u, v]`. The user's code correctly interprets `[u, v]` as `v` is a prerequisite for `u`, and thus creates the edge `v -> u`.
*   **Forgetting `nonlocal`**: When modifying a variable from an outer scope inside a nested function in Python (like `time`), one must declare it `nonlocal`. Omitting `nonlocal time` would raise an `UnboundLocalError`. The user's code correctly includes this.
*   **Cycle Detection Propagation**: A subtle error would be `has_cycle = DFS(adj)` instead of `has_cycle = (has_cycle or DFS(adj))`. The latter correctly ensures that if a cycle is found in *any* recursive branch, the `True` value is preserved, while the former could overwrite a `True` with a `False` from a later, cycle-free branch.
*   **Incorrect Sorting**: Forgetting to sort in `reverse=True` order by finish time would produce an incorrect ordering.
