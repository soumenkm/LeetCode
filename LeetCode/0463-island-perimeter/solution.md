### Code Explanation

#### Key Concepts
The solution uses **Depth-First Search (DFS)** as its core traversal algorithm. This is a form of **Graph Traversal** where the grid itself is treated as an implicit graph. The perimeter calculation is based on a **local neighbor counting** strategy.

#### Identification of Algorithm
The problem asks for the perimeter of a single, connected group of land cells (an "island"). Identifying all cells belonging to a connected component is a classic graph traversal problem. DFS and BFS are the standard algorithms for this. The user has chosen DFS to explore every land cell that is part of the island.

The calculation logic itself doesn't strictly require a traversal (one could iterate over every cell and check its neighbors), but using DFS ensures that each land cell of the island is visited exactly once in an organized manner, which is a clean way to sum up the contributions from each cell.

#### Intuition and Logic
The fundamental idea is that the total perimeter of the island is the sum of the perimeters contributed by each individual land cell. The algorithm traverses the entire island using DFS, and for each land cell it visits, it calculates that cell's contribution and adds it to a running total.

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   `m` and `n`: Store the dimensions of the grid.
    *   `visited`: A 2D array of the same size as the grid, initialized to zeros. It's used to keep track of land cells that have already been visited by the DFS to prevent infinite loops and recounting.
    *   `edge`: An empty list that will store the perimeter contribution of each individual land cell as it's discovered.
    *   `dirs`: A list of tuples representing the four cardinal directions for checking neighbors.

2.  **Helper Function `find_adj(node)`**:
    *   This function takes a `node` (a tuple `(i, j)` of coordinates) and finds all of its valid, adjacent neighbors that are also land (`grid[ni][nj] == 1`).
    *   It returns a list of these neighbors' coordinates. This function is used to know how many sides of a given land cell are connected to other land cells.

3.  **Helper Function `DFS(node)`**:
    *   This is the recursive heart of the algorithm. When it's called on a `node` (a land cell):
    *   It first marks the current cell as visited by setting `visited[i][j] = 1`.
    *   It calls `find_adj(node)` to get the list of adjacent land cells, `adj`.
    *   **The key calculation**: `edge.append(4 - len(adj))`. This line calculates the perimeter contribution of the current cell. Each land cell is a square with 4 sides. If a side is adjacent to another land cell, it is *not* part of the island's external perimeter. Therefore, the number of exposed sides (the perimeter contribution) for the current cell is `4` minus the number of its land neighbors. This value is appended to the `edge` list.
    *   Finally, it iterates through the adjacent land cells found and makes a recursive `DFS` call for any neighbor that has not yet been visited.

4.  **Main Traversal Logic**:
    *   The code uses nested `for` loops to scan the grid to find a starting point for the traversal.
    *   As soon as it finds a land cell (`grid[i][j] == 1`) that hasn't been visited, it initiates the `DFS` from that cell.
    *   Since the problem guarantees there is exactly one island, this single DFS call will visit every land cell belonging to that island.
    *   The `island_found` flag and the `break` statements are used to efficiently exit the search loops once the island has been found and the DFS has started.

5.  **Final Calculation**:
    *   After the DFS traversal is complete, the `edge` list contains the perimeter contributions from every cell in the island.
    *   `perimeter = sum(edge)` simply sums these values to get the total perimeter, which is then returned.

#### "Gotcha" Points and Tricks
*   **Perimeter by Contribution**: The cleverest part of this solution is calculating the perimeter by summing local contributions (`4 - # of land neighbors`) for each land cell, rather than trying to trace the outer border of the island.
*   **Single Island Assumption**: The code effectively uses the problem constraint that there is only one island. This allows it to stop searching for a starting point after the first land cell is found, making the initiation of the DFS very efficient.
*   **Scoped Helper Functions**: The use of nested functions (`find_adj` and `DFS`) is a Pythonic way to structure the code. These functions have access to the parent function's scope (variables like `grid`, `visited`, `edge`), avoiding the need to pass them as parameters.

#### Potential Errors and Pitfalls
*   **Forgetting `visited` Array**: A common mistake in grid traversal is forgetting to track visited nodes. Without the `visited` array, the DFS could get stuck in an infinite recursion between two adjacent cells, leading to a stack overflow. The user's code correctly prevents this.
*   **Incorrect Perimeter Logic**: A developer might miscalculate the contribution. For instance, counting the number of adjacent water cells instead. The user's logic of `4 - len(adj)` where `adj` contains land neighbors is correct and robust.
*   **Multiple Islands Scenario**: If the problem allowed for multiple islands, the user's `island_found` and `break` logic would be incorrect, as it would only calculate the perimeter of the first island it encountered and then stop. The code would need to be modified to continue searching the grid even after one DFS completes.
*   **Off-by-One in Neighbor Check**: Boundary checks like `0 <= ni < m` are critical. An error here could lead to an `IndexError`. The user's code implements these checks correctly in the `find_adj` function.
