### Code Explanation

#### Key Concepts
The solution fundamentally relies on **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, a classic **Graph Traversal** algorithm. The grid is treated as an implicit graph where land cells (`0`s) are nodes, and adjacent land cells have edges between them.

#### Identification of Algorithm
The problem asks to count "closed islands," which are connected components of land cells that do not touch the grid's boundary. To solve this, one must first identify each distinct island (a connected component) and then check if that entire island satisfies the "closed" property. This two-step process—exploring a component and then checking its properties—is a perfect application for a graph traversal algorithm like DFS or BFS. The recursive nature of DFS makes it particularly well-suited for propagating a property (like whether an island touches the border) throughout the entire component.

#### Intuition and Logic
The core strategy is to iterate through every cell of the grid. When an unvisited land cell (`0`) is found, it signifies the start of a new, undiscovered island. A DFS is then launched from this cell to explore the entire island. The purpose of this DFS is to determine if any single cell within this island touches the border of the grid.

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   `m`, `n`: The dimensions of the grid.
    *   `visited`: A 2D array of the same size as `grid`, initialized to zeros, to keep track of cells that have been explored by the DFS. This prevents recounting cells or getting into infinite loops.
    *   `dirs`: A list of tuples representing the four cardinal directions for neighbor checking.

2.  **Helper Function `find_adj(i, j)`**:
    *   This function finds all 4-directionally adjacent land cells to a given cell `(i, j)`. It checks if a neighbor is within the grid boundaries and is also a land cell (`grid[ni][nj] == 0`). It returns a list of coordinates for these valid neighbors.

3.  **Recursive Function `DFS(i, j)`**:
    *   This function is the heart of the solution. It traverses an island and returns a single boolean value: `True` if the island touches the border, and `False` if it does not.
    *   `visited[i][j] = 1`: The current cell is marked as visited.
    *   `is_on_border = True/False`: A local flag `is_on_border` is initialized. It's set to `True` if the *current cell* `(i, j)` is physically on the grid's border, `False` otherwise.
    *   The function then recursively explores all unvisited neighbors via `DFS(x, y)`.
    *   **Crucial Logic**: `if DFS(x, y): is_on_border = True`. This line propagates the "border-touching" property. If *any* recursive call down the line returns `True` (meaning some cell in that part of the island touches the border), the current `is_on_border` flag is also set to `True`. This ensures that if even one cell of the island is on the border, the final result for the entire island will be `True`.
    *   The function ultimately returns the final state of `is_on_border`.

4.  **Main Loop and Counting**:
    *   The main body of the `closedIsland` method iterates through every cell `(i, j)`.
    *   `if grid[i][j] == 0 and visited[i][j] == 0:`: This condition finds the start of a new, unexplored island.
    *   `has_border = DFS(i, j)`: The DFS is called. The return value, `has_border`, will be `True` if the island is "open" (touches the border) and `False` if it is "closed".
    *   `if not has_border: count += 1`: If the DFS confirms that the entire island it just explored does *not* touch the border, the `count` of closed islands is incremented.

5.  **Return Value**: The final `count` is returned.

#### "Gotcha" Points and Tricks
*   **Property Propagation via DFS Return**: The most clever part of this solution is using the DFS's return value to represent a property of the entire connected component. The boolean `is_on_border` acts like a "taint" that, once set to `True` anywhere in the island, spreads to the initial caller.
*   **Checking the Negative Case**: The logic is elegantly framed to find evidence that an island is *not* closed. It's easier to find one border cell and stop than to prove that all cells are not on the border. The main loop then counts the islands for which no such evidence was found.
*   **Comprehensive Traversal**: The combination of the outer `for` loops and the inner `DFS` (with its `visited` check) guarantees that every land cell is visited exactly once and that each island is evaluated as a whole.

#### Potential Errors and Pitfalls
*   **Boolean Propagation Logic**: A common mistake would be to write `is_on_border = DFS(x, y)`. This is incorrect because a `False` return from a later branch could overwrite a `True` value found in an earlier branch. The user's code, `if DFS(x,y): is_on_border = True`, correctly ensures that once the flag is set to `True`, it is never reset to `False` within that island's traversal.
*   **Forgetting `visited` Array**: Without the `visited` grid, the DFS would enter an infinite recursion between adjacent land cells, leading to a stack overflow. The user's code correctly implements this check.
*   **Boundary Condition Errors**: An off-by-one error or an incomplete check in the `if i == 0 or i == m-1 or j == 0 or j == n-1:` line would cause the algorithm to misidentify which islands touch the border. The user's check is complete and correct.
*   **Modifying Grid State**: Some solutions to similar problems modify the grid itself (e.g., changing `0` to `2`) to mark visited cells. While valid, using a separate `visited` grid, as the user does, is often cleaner as it doesn't mutate the input data.
