<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill">733. Flood Fill</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><p>You are given an image represented by an <code>m x n</code> grid of integers <code>image</code>, where <code>image[i][j]</code> represents the pixel value of the image. You are also given three integers <code>sr</code>, <code>sc</code>, and <code>color</code>. Your task is to perform a <strong>flood fill</strong> on the image starting from the pixel <code>image[sr][sc]</code>.</p>

<p>To perform a <strong>flood fill</strong>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to <code>color</code>.</li>
	<li>Perform the same process for each pixel that is <strong>directly adjacent</strong> (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically) and shares the <strong>same color</strong> as the starting pixel.</li>
	<li>Keep <strong>repeating</strong> this process by checking neighboring pixels of the <em>updated</em> pixels&nbsp;and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the starting pixel.</li>
	<li>The process <strong>stops</strong> when there are <strong>no more</strong> adjacent pixels of the original color to update.</li>
</ol>

<p>Return the <strong>modified</strong> image after performing the flood fill.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<div class="example-block">
<p><strong>Input:</strong> <span class="example-io">image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2</span></p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> <span class="example-io">[[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]</span></p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/01/flood1-grid.jpg" style="width: 613px; height: 253px;" /></p>

<p>From the center of the image with position <code>(sr, sc) = (1, 1)</code> (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.</p>

<p>Note the bottom corner is <strong>not</strong> colored 2, because it is not horizontally or vertically connected to the starting pixel.</p>
</div>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<div class="example-block">
<p><strong>Input:</strong> <span class="example-io">image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0</span></p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong> <span class="example-io">[[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]</span></p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>

<p>The starting pixel is already colored with 0, which is the same as the target color. Therefore, no changes are made to the image.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>m == image.length</code></li>
	<li><code>n == image[i].length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 50</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= image[i][j], color &lt; 2<sup>16</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= sr &lt; m</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= sc &lt; n</code></li>

### Code Explanation

#### Key Concepts
The solution uses **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, which is a classic **Graph Traversal** algorithm. The image grid is treated as an implicit graph where pixels are nodes and adjacent pixels with the same color are connected by edges.

#### Identification of Algorithm
The problem describes an operation that starts at a point and spreads to all "connected" and "similar" neighbors. This process of exploring a connected component from a starting node is a textbook application for graph traversal algorithms. The recursive nature of the problem description ("repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the updated pixels") maps naturally to the recursive implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS).

#### Intuition and Logic
The core idea is to find all pixels connected to the starting pixel `(sr, sc)` that share its original color and change their color to the new `color`. The user's code achieves this with a recursive DFS function.

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   `m` and `n` store the grid dimensions.
    *   `visited`: A 2D array of the same size as the `image` is created and initialized to zeros. This is crucial for tracking which pixels have been processed by the `DFS` to avoid infinite loops between adjacent pixels.
    *   `dirs`: A list of tuples representing the four cardinal directions for finding neighbors.
    *   `res = image.copy()`: A shallow copy of the image is made. The `res` variable will be modified. Because this is a shallow copy of a list of lists, modifying `res[i][j]` will also modify the original `image[i][j]`.

2.  **Helper Function `find_adj(i, j)`**:
    *   This function finds valid neighbors for a pixel at `(i, j)`.
    *   A neighbor `(ni, nj)` is considered valid if it's within the grid boundaries (`0 <= ni < m` and `0 <= nj < n`) AND its color is the same as the *original* starting pixel's color (`image[ni][nj] == image[sr][sc]`). This condition is the key to the flood fill logic.

3.  **Recursive Function `DFS(i, j)`**:
    *   This function performs the traversal and coloring. When called on a pixel `(i, j)`:
    *   `visited[i][j] = 1`: It first marks the current pixel as visited.
    *   It then calls `find_adj(i, j)` to get all valid neighbors and iterates through them.
    *   For each neighbor `(x, y)` that has not been visited (`visited[x][y] == 0`), it makes a recursive call: `DFS(x, y)`.
    *   `res[i][j] = color`: **After** all the recursive calls for its neighbors have returned, it finally changes the color of the current pixel `(i, j)` to the new `color`. This is a post-order traversal modification.

4.  **Execution**:
    *   The process is kicked off by calling `DFS(sr, sc)` on the starting pixel.
    *   The function returns the modified `res` grid.

#### "Gotcha" Points and Tricks
*   **Persistent Original Color Check**: The `find_adj` function cleverly always compares neighbor colors against `image[sr][sc]`. This ensures that even as the `res` (and `image`) grid is being modified, the condition for what constitutes part of the "floodable" area remains constant and correct.
*   **Post-Order Modification**: By changing the color `res[i][j] = color` *after* the recursive calls, the implementation avoids potential logical issues that can arise from changing the grid's state while it's still being used to find neighbors for the current traversal path.
*   **Shallow Copy Subtlety**: The code uses `res = image.copy()`. This creates a new list `res`, but the inner lists are still references to the inner lists of `image`. While this works, it means that `res` and `image` are not truly independent. The code effectively performs an in-place modification.

#### Potential Errors and Pitfalls
*   **Infinite Recursion on Same Color Fill**: A potential issue arises if the starting pixel's color is already the target `color`. For example, `image = [[0,0,0], [0,0,0]]`, `sr = 0`, `sc = 0`, `color = 0`. The user's code will still perform a full DFS traversal, visiting every cell and "re-coloring" it to the same color. For a very large grid, this could lead to a `RecursionError` (stack overflow). A common optimization, not present here, is to check `if image[sr][sc] == color: return image` at the very beginning.
*   **Forgetting the `visited` Grid**: The most common mistake in this type of problem is omitting the `visited` grid. Without it, the `DFS` would bounce between two adjacent, same-colored pixels, leading to an infinite recursion and a stack overflow. The user's code correctly uses `visited` to prevent this.
*   **Incorrect Neighbor Condition**: A developer might mistakenly check `image[ni][nj] == image[i][j]` inside `find_adj`. This could work with post-order coloring, but it's less robust and could fail if the coloring were done pre-order. The user's choice to always check against the fixed `image[sr][sc]` is safer.
