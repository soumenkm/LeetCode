### Code Explanation

#### Key Concepts
The solution uses a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm to traverse the graph. This DFS is enhanced with two key features:
1.  **Cycle Detection**: It uses the standard 3-color system (white, gray, black) to detect cycles within the directed graph.
2.  **Memoization / Dynamic Programming**: It uses an auxiliary array (`safe`) to store the computed safety status of each node, so the result for a node is calculated only once.

#### Identification of Algorithm
The problem defines a "safe node" as a node from which all paths lead to a terminal node. This is equivalent to saying a node is safe if and only if it is not part of a cycle and cannot reach a cycle. The problem of determining if a node can reach a cycle is a classic graph problem solved by DFS.

A DFS traversal can detect cycles in a directed graph by keeping track of the nodes currently in the recursion stack. The user implements this using a `color` array: a node in the current recursion stack (`color == 1`, gray) that is visited again indicates a cycle. By augmenting this DFS to also remember the final "safe" or "unsafe" status of each visited node, we can efficiently solve the problem for the entire graph.

#### Intuition and Logic
The core idea is to perform a DFS from every unvisited node in the graph. During the DFS, the algorithm determines if the current node is "safe". A node is considered unsafe if it's part of a cycle or if any of its neighbors lead to an unsafe path.

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   `V`: The total number of nodes (courses).
    *   `color`: An array to track the state of each node during DFS. `0` (white) means unvisited, `1` (gray) means currently in the recursion stack, `2` (black) means fully explored.
    *   `safe`: An array to memoize the result. `safe[i]` will be `True` if node `i` is safe, `False` otherwise. It's initialized with `None`.

2.  **Recursive `DFS(node)` Function**:
    *   This function determines if `node` is safe and populates `safe[node]`.
    *   `color[node] = 1`: The node is marked as "visiting" (gray).
    *   `is_safe = True`: The function starts with the optimistic assumption that the current node is safe. It then looks for any evidence to the contrary.
    *   The function iterates through all adjacent nodes (`adj`) of the current `node`:
        *   **`if color[adj] == 0`**: The neighbor is unvisited (white). The code recursively calls `DFS(adj)` to determine its safety first. Afterwards, it updates the current node's status: `is_safe = (is_safe and safe[adj])`. This means the current `node` can only be safe if it was already considered safe AND the path through `adj` is also safe. If any neighbor `adj` is unsafe, `is_safe` becomes `False`.
        *   **`elif color[adj] == 1`**: The neighbor is gray. This means we've encountered a node that's already in the current recursion stack. This is a back edge, which proves a cycle exists. Therefore, the current `node` is part of a cycle and is unsafe. `is_safe` is set to `False`.
        *   **`elif color[adj] == 2 and safe[adj] == False`**: The neighbor is fully explored (black), and we have already determined that it is an unsafe node. Since the current `node` can reach a known unsafe node, it is also unsafe. `is_safe` is set to `False`.
    *   `color[node] = 2`: After exploring all neighbors, the node is marked as fully explored (black).
    *   `safe[node] = is_safe`: The final computed safety status is stored in the `safe` array for memoization.

3.  **Main Execution**:
    *   A `for` loop iterates through all nodes `i` from `0` to `V-1`.
    *   If a node `i` is still unvisited (`color[i] == 0`), it initiates a `DFS(i)` call. This ensures all nodes in all connected components of the graph are processed.

4.  **Result Formatting**:
    *   The code then processes the `safe` array to produce the final output.
    *   `safe_map = list(zip(range(V), safe))`: Creates pairs of `(node_index, safety_status)`.
    *   `res = sorted(list(filter(lambda x: x[1] == True, safe_map)))`: This line filters the pairs to keep only the safe ones, converts the result to a list, and then sorts it. The sort works correctly because Python sorts tuples element by element, so it will sort by the node index.
    *   `return [i for i, _ in res]`: Extracts the node indices from the sorted, filtered list and returns them.

#### "Gotcha" Points and Tricks
*   **Definition of Safe**: The code correctly captures the two conditions that make a node unsafe: being in a cycle (`color[adj] == 1`) or being able to reach an unsafe node (`safe[adj] == False`).
*   **Post-Order Logic**: The safety of a node (`safe[node]`) is determined *after* all of its children have been processed by the DFS. This post-order assignment is crucial because a node's safety is dependent on the safety of all nodes it can reach.
*   **Combined DFS and DP**: The algorithm elegantly combines cycle detection (using `color`) and dynamic programming/memoization (using `safe`) in a single DFS traversal. Re-visiting a black node (`color == 2`) allows the DFS to immediately reuse the pre-computed `safe[adj]` result, avoiding redundant computations.

#### Potential Errors and Pitfalls
*   **Incorrect Safety Logic**: A common error would be to not handle all cases. Forgetting the `elif color[adj] == 2` check would make the algorithm fail if a node could reach a cycle that was discovered in a separate, earlier DFS call. The user's code correctly checks all three states of the neighbor.
*   **Missing Main Loop**: Only calling `DFS(0)` and not looping through all nodes would fail for graphs with multiple disconnected components. The user's `for i in range(V):` loop correctly handles this.
*   **Overly Complex Result Formatting**: While functionally correct, the final three lines for filtering and formatting the result are more complex than necessary. A more direct and Pythonic way to achieve the same result would be a single list comprehension: `[i for i, is_safe in enumerate(safe) if is_safe]`, as the indices are already sorted.
*   **Boolean Logic**: Using `or` instead of `and` in `is_safe = (is_safe and safe[adj])` would be a critical logic error, as a node is only safe if *all* its paths are safe.
