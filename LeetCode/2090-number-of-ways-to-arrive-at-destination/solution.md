### Code Explanation

#### Key Concepts
The user's code implements a modified version of **Dijkstra's Algorithm**. This algorithm is enhanced with a **Dynamic Programming** approach to count the number of shortest paths. The core data structures used are an **Adjacency List** to represent the graph and a **Priority Queue** (min-heap) to efficiently drive the algorithm.

#### Identification of Algorithm
The problem asks for the "number of ways" to travel in the "shortest amount of time." This is a strong indicator that a standard shortest path algorithm alone is not sufficient.
1.  **Shortest Path**: The "shortest amount of time" on a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights points directly to Dijkstra's algorithm.
2.  **Counting Paths**: The "number of ways" requirement means we need to augment the standard algorithm. As Dijkstra's finds the shortest path to each node, we can simultaneously keep track of *how many* distinct paths achieve that shortest distance.

This combination leads to a modified Dijkstra's where, in addition to tracking distances, we also track the number of ways to achieve those distances.

#### Intuition and Logic
The algorithm works by extending Dijkstra's. While the standard algorithm only cares about finding the minimum distance to each node, this version also maintains a `ways` array. `ways[i]` stores the number of distinct shortest paths from the `src` node to node `i`.

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   `src = 0`, `dest = n - 1`: Defines the start and end nodes.
    *   `adjList`: An adjacency list is built from the `roads` input to represent the bi-directional graph. Each entry stores a tuple `(neighbor, weight)`.
    *   `dist`: An array to store the shortest distance found so far from `src` to every other node. It is initialized with infinity.
    *   `ways`: An array to store the number of shortest paths to each node. It is initialized with `0`.
    *   `PQ`: A min-priority queue is initialized with `(0, src)`, representing the starting node with a distance of 0.
    *   `dist[src] = 0` and `ways[src] = 1`: These are the crucial base cases. The distance to the source is 0, and there is exactly one way to get there (by starting there).

2.  **Modified Dijkstra's Loop**:
    *   The `while` loop runs as long as the priority queue `PQ` is not empty.
    *   `d, node = heapq.heappop(PQ)`: It extracts the node that is currently closest to the source. `d` is the shortest known distance to `node`.
    *   The code then iterates through all neighbors (`adj`) of the current `node`. For each neighbor, there are two critical possibilities:

3.  **Path Relaxation and Counting Logic**:
    *   **Case 1: A new, shorter path is found (`d + w < dist[adj]`)**:
        *   This means the path through the current `node` is better than any path found to `adj` so far.
        *   `dist[adj] = d + w`: The shortest distance to `adj` is updated.
        *   `heapq.heappush(PQ, (d+w, adj))`: The new, better path to `adj` is added to the priority queue.
        *   `ways[adj] = ways[node]`: This is the key insight. Since we've found a completely new shortest path, all previous ways of reaching `adj` are now invalid. The number of ways to get to `adj` along this new shortest path is exactly the number of ways we could get to the predecessor, `node`.
    *   **Case 2: A path of the exact same length is found (`d + w == dist[adj]`)**:
        *   This means we've discovered an alternative path to `adj` that is just as good as the existing shortest path(s).
        *   `ways[adj] += ways[node]`: We don't need to update the distance or re-add to the queue, but we must update the count. We add the number of ways to reach the predecessor `node` to the existing ways of reaching `adj`.

4.  **Result**:
    *   After the loop finishes, `ways[dest]` (or `ways[-1]`) will contain the total count of paths that have the shortest possible travel time.
    *   `return ways[-1] % MOD`: The final result is returned modulo `10**9 + 7` as required.

#### "Gotcha" Points and Tricks
*   **Augmenting Dijkstra's**: The core trick is not just finding the shortest path but using the `ways` array to carry additional state through the traversal. This turns a path-finding algorithm into a path-counting one.
*   **The `elif` Condition**: The `elif d + w == dist[adj]:` logic is the non-standard part of Dijkstra's and is the key to solving the problem. It correctly handles the accumulation of paths when multiple routes have the same minimum cost.
*   **Reset vs. Accumulate**: The code correctly distinguishes between finding a *strictly better* path (which resets the `ways` count for the destination node) and finding an *equally good* path (which adds to the `ways` count).

#### Potential Errors and Pitfalls
*   **Forgetting the `elif` Case**: A developer implementing standard Dijkstra's would miss the `elif` condition entirely and would only be able to find one shortest path, not count them all.
*   **Incorrect `ways` Update**: A common mistake would be to mix up the logic. For example, adding to `ways[adj]` when a shorter path is found (instead of resetting it) or resetting it when an equal path is found (instead of adding to it). The user's code implements the logic correctly.
*   **Modulo Application**: In Python, with its arbitrary-precision integers, applying the modulo operation at the very end is acceptable. In languages with fixed-size integers, a developer might need to apply the modulo inside the loop (`ways[adj] = (ways[adj] + ways[node]) % MOD`) to prevent potential overflow.
*   **Stale Priority Queue Entries**: The code might push multiple entries for the same node into the `PQ`. For example, `(10, v)` might be pushed, and later `(8, v)`. The algorithm handles this correctly because the logic always compares against the up-to-date `dist[adj]`, so when the stale `(10, v)` is eventually popped, its `d` of 10 will be greater than the stored `dist[v]` of 8, and it won't proceed.
